## <h1 align="center" id="heading">Evaluating Advanced Retrieval Methods in LangChain with RAGAS!</h1>


# Week 2: Thursday Session

In today's assignment, we'll be evaluating advanced retrieval methods with RAGAS.
  
There are 3 main sections to this assignment:

## Build 🏗️

Following the provided notebook.

This will take you through three major steps: 

1. Collecting and parsing data
2. Create our ground truth
3. Evaluating our RAG pipelines using RAGAS


## Ship 🚢

Complete the notebook

## Share 🚀

Make a social media post about your final application!

### Deliverables
- A short Loom of the notebook describing the processing step by step.
- 3 Key lessons learned and not learned.
- Make a post on any social media platform about what you built!

Here's a template to get you started:
